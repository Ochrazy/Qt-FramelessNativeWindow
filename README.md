# Qt-FramelessNativeWindow

This project is work in progress. 

The Qt-FramelessNativeWindow is a frameless Qt Desktop Window with added support for native OS-features.
Supported platforms are Windows 10, Macos and Unix/Linux. 

On Windows 10 the native OS features supported are:
- Resizable
- Draggable
- Minimize animation
- Aero snap support
- Aero shake support

On top of that a custom translucent blur effect is implemented. This works by taking screenshots and setting a blurred version of the image as the background of the Qt-Widget. For it to work properly the Qt-Window needs to be hidden before taking the screenshot. This is done everytime the Window gets activated. The drawbacks of this method are that the window disappears for a short amount of time when activated and that only static images are captured. So when a video is playing behind the Qt-Window a screenshot is taken once and shown as a blurred image until the window gets activated again.
